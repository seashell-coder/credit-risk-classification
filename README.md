## Overview of the Analysis
The purpose of this analysis was to build a machine learning model to predict the likelihood of loan default based on financial information. The dataset contains various financial attributes of borrowers, such as loan size, interest rate, borrower income, debt-to-income ratio, number of accounts, and derogatory marks. The target variable, "loan_status," indicates whether a loan is healthy (0) or high-risk (1).

### Instructions
The instructions for this Challenge are divided into the following subsections:
     * Split the Data into Training and Testing Sets
     * Create a Logistic Regression Model with the Original Data
     * Write a Credit Risk Analysis Report

### Methods used:
    - The Logistic Regression Model was used to predict the likelihood of loan default based on the given financial attributes.
      * Data preprocessing: The dataset was loaded, and features and target variables were separated. The data was split into training and testing sets.
      * Model training: Logistic Regression model was instantiated and trained using the training data.
      * Model evaluation: The model was evaluated using confusion matrices, classification reports, and accuracy scores.
